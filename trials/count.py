text="Canada Revenue Agency Agence du revenu du Canada Solicitation No. 1000355275/A Page 12 of 83 Evaluation and Selection 4.1 General A committee composed of representatives of CRA will evaluate the proposals on behalf of the Agency. The services of independent consultants may be called upon to assist in the evaluation of, or in the validation of, specific aspects of the solution proposed. CRA reserves the right to engage any independent consultant, or use any Government resources, which it deems necessary to evaluate any proposal. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified in Appendices 1 and 2 and in conjunction with the Statement of Requirements (SOR). Bidders are encouraged to address these criteria in sufficient depth in their proposals to permit a full evaluation of their proposals. The onus is on the Bidder to demonstrate that it meets the requirements specified in the solicitation. Bidders are advised that only listing experience without providing any supporting information to describe where and how such experience was obtained will not be considered to be demonstrated for the purpose of the evaluation. The Bidder should not assume that the evaluation team is necessarily cognizant of or knowledgeable about the experience and capabilities of the Bidder or any of the proposed resource(s); as such, any relevant experience must be demonstrated in the Bidders’ written proposal. 4.2 Steps in the Evaluation Process The selection process to determine the successful Bidder will be carried out as follows: Notwithstanding Steps 1 and 2 below, in order to expedite the evaluation process, the CRA reserves the right to conduct Step 3 - Evaluation of Financial Proposals concurrently with Steps 1 and 2. Should the CRA elect to conduct Step 3 prior to the completion of Step 2, the information in the Financial Proposal will not be disclosed to the team evaluating the mandatory and rated sections until the completion of Steps 1 and 2. However, if the Contracting Authority is able to ascertain that a proposal is non-responsive by virtue of incomplete information or an error in the financial proposal, the Contracting Authority will advise the team evaluating the mandatory and rated sections that the proposal is not compliant and should no longer be considered. The concurrent evaluation of the financial proposal does not in any way construe compliance in Steps 1 and 2 despite the statement \"All bids will then proceed to Step 3\". Step 1 – Evaluation against Mandatory Criteria All bids will be evaluated to determine if the mandatory requirements detailed in Appendix 1: Mandatory Criteria have been met. Only those bids meeting ALL mandatory requirements will then be evaluated in accordance with Step 2 below. Step 2 – Evaluation against Point-Rated Criteria All bids will be evaluated and scored, in accordance with the point-rated criteria detailed in Appendix 2: Point Rated Criteria, to determine the Bidder’s Total Technical Merit Score. All bids will then proceed to Step 3. Step 3 – Evaluation of Financial Proposals Only technically compliant bids meeting all of the requirements detailed in Steps 1 and 2 will be considered at this point. Prices submitted will be evaluated to determine the Total Evaluated Cost as defined in Appendix 3: Financial Proposal. Bidders must provide a price for each item identified in the format specified in Appendix 3: Financial Proposal. Ranges (e.g., $10-$13) are not acceptable. Once the Total Evaluated Cost is determined under Step 3, the proposals will proceed to Step 4."
